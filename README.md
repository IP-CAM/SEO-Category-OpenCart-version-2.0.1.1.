# SEOCategory-Opencart
SEO Categories is a module that was developed for OpenCart version 2.0.1.1.

Generates categories that use the name of a category and the name of the manufacturers in that category, and thus can drive traffic because of the linkage to brand search.

The module has functionality that can be attached to Cronjob to automatically generate and add products to the new special categories.

The module may need additional setup.
I am not responsible for the use of the module.

If you need help with configuration you can contact me.
